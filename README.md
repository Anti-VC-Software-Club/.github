# Anti VC Software Club

Anti VC Software Club is a group of engineers, designers, and product leaders exploring new software products that don't require venture capital funding to succeed. We are focused on building sustainable value for our customers with a focus on profitability. 

We believe the costs of developing great software will continue to decline in an age where AI empowers engineers and designers to do more with less at a much faster pace than historically thought possible.
